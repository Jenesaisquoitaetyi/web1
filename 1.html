  <h2><u>Minimalism</u>이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p>So what is this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism" target="_blank" title="minimalism">minimalism</a> thing? It’s quite simple: to be a minimalist you must live with less than 100 things, you can’t own a car or a home or a television, you can’t have a career, you must live in exotic hard-to-pronounce places all over the world, you must start a blog, you can’t have children, and you must be a young white male from a privileged background.</p>

  <p><p style="margin-top:30px;">OK, we’re joking—obviously. But people who dismiss minimalism as some sort of fad usually mention any of the above “restrictions” as to why they could “never be a minimalist.” Minimalism isn’t about any of those things, but it can help you accomplish them. If you desire to live with fewer material possessions, or not own a car or a television, or travel all over the world, then minimalism can lend a hand. But that’s not the point.</script>></p>
